play this song next / add to end of current playlist
view for currently playing songs -- fix -- make less ugly
support for playlists on device
move items around in current playlist view (like doubletwist)
skip count increment -- do it in the right places
record every play/time/duration instead of keeping count?
filtering based on counts/skips
foreground process -- notification bar, so we don't get killed ?? how do we do this ?? I'm simmingish it now
start foreground issue -- is that because service is in the same process/thread? -- killing player kills service/playing
lifecycle stuff
let go of resources during onpause/ondestroy!!!!
broadcast album/artist/song changes?

merging artists? -- recommendations, multiple merges (eminem, jayz feat eminem) and (jayz, jayz feat eminem)
