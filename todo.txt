play time/ seek bar update
move bar doesn't cause weird sound artifacts
prev
repeat
shuffle (selection without replacement?)
play this song next / add to end of current playlist
view for currently playing songs -- fix -- make less ugly
playlist support
move items around in playlist view (like doubletwist)
skip count increment
record every play/time/duration instead of keeping count?
add a like/dislike feature
filtering based on counts/skips
foreground process -- notification bar, so we don't get killed ?? how do we do this ?? I'm simmingish it now
start foreground issue -- is that because service is in the same process/thread? -- killing player kills service/playing
lifecycle stuff
let go of resources during onpause/ondestroy!!!!
broadcast album/artist/song changes?

analysis on plays/time/duration/skips
web display of plays/time/durations/skips? seems unnecessary to display it all. how do you make info relevant?
pretty ui for player
lock screen
widget
