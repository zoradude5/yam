play time/ seek bar update
move bar doesn't cause weird sound artifacts
metadata for current song
prev
for scroller thing with letter
repeat
shuffle (selection without replacement?)
play this song next / add to end of current playlist
support for playlists on device
move items around in current playlist view (like doubletwist)
skip count increment -- do it in the right places
record every play/time/duration instead of keeping count?
filtering based on counts/skips
foreground process -- notification bar, so we don't get killed ?? how do we do this ?? I'm simmingish it now
start foreground issue -- is that because service is in the same process/thread? -- killing player kills service/playing
lifecycle stuff
let go of resources during onpause/ondestroy!!!!
broadcast album/artist/song changes?


I would prefer sectioning to make position on scroll thing be equal for every section... so m is halfway down.g is a quarter down. right now, "section" from toolbar is based on where that section starts ont he list
merging artists? -- recommendations, multiple merges (eminem, jayz feat eminem) and (jayz, jayz feat eminem)
analysis on plays/time/duration/skips
web display of plays/time/durations/skips? seems unnecessary to display it all. how do you make info relevant?
pretty ui for player
lock screen
widget
